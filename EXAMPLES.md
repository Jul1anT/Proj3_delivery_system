- For real practice, use more localized routes

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Nearby Points
- For real routes, use points in the same city or region
- Shorter distances = more accurate calculations

### 2. Optimal Quantity
- 5-20 points is ideal for most cases
- 2-4 points: very simple route
- 20-50 points: still manageable
- 50+ points: consider splitting into multiple routes

### 3. Coordinate Precision
- Use at least 4 decimals: `4.7110, -74.0721`
- More decimals = more precision

### 4. Geocoding
- Be specific: "Eiffel Tower, Paris, France"
- Include city and country when possible
- Verify the location is correct on the map

### 5. GPS Navigation
- Use GPS buttons when you're ready to go
- Google Maps will open with route from your location
- Works best on mobile devices

- Get coordinates from Google Maps: right-click → coordinates

### "Route doesn't seem optimal"
- **Note**: The algorithm is heuristic, not always perfect
- For best results, use well-distributed points

### "Many points, slow calculation"
- **Solution**: Split into smaller routes
- System works best with 5-30 points
